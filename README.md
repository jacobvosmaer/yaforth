# Building a Forth

Run tests with `make test` or `prove`.


## What is this

Forth is a programming language or rather a family of programming languages. There is no one Forth.

In this repository I am experimenting with building my own Forth.
This started out based on [steps by Hacker News user "tzs"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13082825). I'm slowly moving it closer to [Jonesforth](http://git.annexia.org/?p=jonesforth.git;a=blob;f=jonesforth.S;h=45e6e854a5d2a4c3f26af264dfce56379d401425;hb=HEAD).
